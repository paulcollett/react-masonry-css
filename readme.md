### üòé Why?

Existing solutions like React wrapped DeSandro Masonry, while great had downfalls in our react app. It required rendering the DOM on load and on during resize before determining the layout which lead to a slow, laggy experiance that in our experiance would occasionally break the layout completely during resize. It also had depenancies on jQuery and while being feature packed it showed in resulting file size.

To combat this, we looked into the latest techniques using just CSS, including flexbox & grid which fell short for anything other than basic images. CSS columns came the closest though the ordering reflow (orders down each column before reflowing to the next) visually broke when working with large different sized  elements.

Plain ol, div columns to the rescue!

*`react-masonry-css`* Is a React Component with a simple interface to order items into the desired columns at specified breakpoints. With minimal CSS this leads to a quick, reliable solution that also has great browser support along with rendering performance.

#### üè≥Ô∏è What doesn't this do

* Animate when sorting
* Work with elements with different widths
* Box algorithm (not really needed if your elements have the same width)
* Break when resizing (at least, thats the goal)
* Load and render the DOM before sorting out the layout <= actually thats a plus

#### üòÑ What does this do
* Responsive! ..always
* IE 9+ CSS Support
* Depedancy & jQuery free
* Work with existing load animations (say fade in)
* CSS powered (Fast loading & Performant)
* Allow for Gutters


### üò≤ Simple Usage

Add `react-masonry-css` to your project:

|-----------------:|:-----------------------------------:|:-------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   breakpointCols |             {default: 2}            | Object  | Breakpoints of the columns.  [Responsive Breakpoints](#responsive-breakpoints) |
|        itemStyle |                  {}                 | Object  | Direct styling of the individual elements.                                     |

|           gutter |                  30                 | Integer | The gutter size given in pixels.                                               |
|        className |          'my-masonry-grid'          | String  | Class name of the Masonry component.                                           |
|  columnClassName |       'my-masonry-grid_column'      | String  | Class name of the columns.                                                     |

### Responsive Breakpoints

Different columns can be specified by passing an object containing key's of the window widths and their value as the number of columns. To have a fallback value, use the `default` key.

```JSX

const breakpointCols = {
  default: 4,
  1100: 3,
  700: 2,
  500: 1
};

//...

<Masonry {...{breakpointCols}}>
  <div>My Element</div>
  <div>My Element</div>
  <div>My Element</div>
  <div>My Element</div>
</Masonry>
```

### Example Demo

### Common usage

**outputting an array of items:**
```JSX
const items = [
  {id: 1, name: 'My First Item'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Another item'},
  {id: 3, name: 'Third Item'},
  {id: 4, name: 'Here is the Fourth'},
  {id: 5, name: 'High Five'}
];

// Convert array to JSX items
items = items.map(({id, name}) => (
    <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
  )
);

<Masonry>
  {items}
</Masonry>
```

### Optional, Responsive gutters
We can add the following to the above CSS to further adjust the layout between screen sizes.
```SCSS
// Optional, different gutter size on mobile
@media (max-width: 650px) {
  .my-masonry-grid {
    margin-left: -15px; // gutter size offset
  }
  .my-masonry-grid_column {
    border-left-width: 15px; // gutter size offset
  }
  .my-masonry-grid_item {
    margin-bottom: 15px; // space between items
  }
}
```
